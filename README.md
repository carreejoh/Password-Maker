# Password-Maker
A website that randomly generates a password based on 5 types of criteria.

# Description 
This website takes in 5 types of user input. The first being char length (8-128), and then 4 types of binary input regarding which types of characters to use. A function in javascript then chooses a random index number within an array and assigns a random character to the new password. The function also includes boundries which must be met in order for the password generator to work. The generator also resets the password every time a new one is created. This website is built primarily with javascript.
